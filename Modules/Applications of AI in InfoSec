Spam Classification

Spam, or unsolicited bulk messaging, has been a persistent issue since the early days of digital communication

Bayes Theorem is a fundamental conecept in probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event 

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring, given that B is true.
P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring, given that A is true.
P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

Downloading the Dataset

The first step in our process is to download this dataset, and we'll do it programmatically in our notebook.

We use the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the URL of the dataset. 

We check the status code of the response to determine if the download was successful (status_code == 200).

After downloading the dataset, we need to extract its contents. The dataset is provided in a .zip file format, which we will handle using Python's zipfile and io libraries.

response.content contains the binary data of the downloaded .zip file. We use io.BytesIO to convert this binary data into a bytes-like object that can be processed by zipfile.ZipFile. 

Loading the Dataset

we can now load it into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis. The SMS Spam Collection dataset is stored in a tab-separated
values (TSV) file format, which we specify using the sep parameter in pd.read_csv.

After loading the dataset, it is important to inspect it for basic information, missing values, and duplicates. 
This helps ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis.


To get an overview of the dataset, we can use the head, describe, and info methods provided by pandas.

df.head() displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, giving us a quick look at the data.
df.describe() provides a statistical summary of the numerical columns in the DataFrame. Although our dataset is primarily text-based, this can still be useful for understanding the distribution of labels.
df.info() gives a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the number of non-null entries and the data types of each column.

The isnull method returns a DataFrame of the same shape as the original, with boolean values indicating whether each entry is null. The sum method then counts the number of True values in each column, giving us the total number of missing entries.

Preprocessing the Spam Dataset


After loading the SMS Spam Collection dataset, the next step is preprocessing the text data. 

Preprocessing standardizes the text, reduces noise, and extracts meaningful features, all of which improve the performance of the Bayes spam classifier.

Before processing any text, you must download the required NLTK data files. 
These include punkt for tokenization and stopwords for removing common words that do not contribute to meaning.

Lowercasing the Text

Lowercasing the text ensures that the classifier treats words equally, regardless of their original casing.

By converting all characters to lowercase, the model considers "Free" and "free" as the same token, effectively reducing dimensionality and improving consistency.

Removing Punctuation and Numbers

Removing unnecessary punctuation and numbers simplifies the dataset by focusing on meaningful words.

However, certain symbols such as $ and ! may contain important context in spam messages. 

Tokenizing the Text

Tokenization divides the message text into individual words or tokens 

we prepare the data for operations like removing stop words and applying stemming

Each token corresponds to a meaningful unit, allowing downstream processes to operate on smaller, standardized elements rather than entire sentences.

the dataset contains messages represented as lists of words, ready for additional preprocessing steps that further refine the text data.

Removing Stop Words

Removing them reduces noise and focuses the model on the words most likely to help distinguish spam from ham messages.
By reducing the number of non-informative tokens, we help the model learn more efficiently.

Stemming

Stemming normalizes words by reducing them to their base form (e.g., running becomes run).

cutting the vocabulary size and smoothing out the text representation

the model can better understand the underlying concepts without being distracted by trivial variations in word forms.

Feature Extraction

Feature extraction transforms preprocessed SMS messages into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms

models cannot directly process raw text data so they rely on numeric representations—such as counts or frequencies of words—to identify patterns that differentiate spam from ham.


Representing Text as Numerical Features

A common way to represent text numerically is through a bag-of-words model.

This technique constructs a vocabulary of unique terms from the dataset and represents each message as a vector of term counts

Each element in the vector corresponds to a term in the vocabulary, and its value indicates how often that term appears in the message.

Using only unigrams (individual words) does not preserve the original word order; it treats each document as a collection of terms and their frequencies, independent of sequence.

To introduce a limited sense of order, we also include bigrams, which are pairs of consecutive words. By incorporating bigrams, we capture some local ordering information.


Using CountVectorizer for the Bag-of-Words Approach

CountVectorizer from the scikit-learn library efficiently implements the bag-of-words approach. 

It converts a collection of documents into a matrix of term counts,
where each row represents a message and each column corresponds to a term (unigram or bigram). 

Before transformation, CountVectorizer applies tokenization, builds a vocabulary, and then maps each document to a numeric vector.


min_df=1: A term must appear in at least one document to be included. While this threshold is set to 1 here, higher values can be used in practice to exclude rare terms.

max_df=0.9: Terms that appear in more than 90% of the documents are excluded, removing overly common words that provide limited differentiation.

ngram_range=(1, 2): The feature matrix captures individual words and common word pairs by including unigrams and bigrams, potentially improving the model’s ability to detect spam patterns.

CountVectorizer operates in three main stages:

Tokenization: Splits the text into tokens based on the specified ngram_range. For ngram_range=(1, 2), it extracts both unigrams (like "message") and bigrams (like "free prize").

Building the Vocabulary: Uses min_df and max_df to decide which terms to include. Terms that are too rare or common are filtered out, leaving a vocabulary that balances informative and distinctive terms.

Vectorization: Transforms each document into a vector of term counts. Each vector entry corresponds to a term from the vocabulary, and its value represents how many times that term appears in the document.


Training and Evaluation (Spam Detection)

Training

we train a machine-learning model for spam detection.

We use the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is well-suited for text classification tasks due to its probabilistic nature and ability to efficiently handle large, sparse feature sets.

we employ a Pipeline. A pipeline chains together the vectorization and modeling steps, ensuring that the same data transformation (in this case, CountVectorizer) is consistently applied before feeding the transformed data into the classifier.

This approach simplifies both development and maintenance by encapsulating the feature extraction and model training into a single, unified workflow.

we can easily integrate hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

The objective is to find optimal parameter values for the classifier, ensuring that the model generalizes well and avoids overfitting.

we use GridSearchCV. This method systematically searches through specified hyperparameter values to identify the configuration that produces the best performance. In the case of MultinomialNB, we focus on the alpha parameter, a smoothing factor that adjusts how the model handles unseen words and prevents probabilities from being zero. We can balance bias and variance by tuning alpha, ultimately improving the model’s robustness.

combination of Pipeline and GridSearchCV ensures a clean, consistent workflow. 

First, CountVectorizer converts raw text into numeric features suitable for the classifier. 

Next, MultinomialNB applies its probabilistic principles to distinguish between spam and ham messages.

Finally, by evaluating alpha values and leveraging cross-validation, we reliably select the best configuration based on the F1-score, a balanced metric for precision and recall.

After training and fine-tuning the spam detection model, assessing its performance on new, unseen SMS messages is critical.

evaluation helps verify how well the model generalizes to real-world data and highlights improvement areas.

Making Predictions

we feed the new messages into the trained MultinomialNB classifier (best_model.named_steps["classifier"]). This classifier outputs both a predicted label (spam or not spam) and class probabilities, indicating the model’s confidence in its decision.

Displaying Predictions and Probabilities

we display:

The original text of the message.
The predicted label (Spam or Not-Spam).
The probability that the message is spam.
The probability that the message is not spam.

Using joblib for Saving Models
By saving the model to a file, users can avoid the computational expense of retraining it from scratch each time. 
 
This is especially helpful in production environments where quick predictions are required.

joblib is a Python library designed to efficiently serialize and deserialize Python objects, particularly those containing large arrays such as NumPy arrays or scikit-learn models. 

Serialization converts an in-memory object into a format that can be stored on disk or transmitted across networks. 

Deserialization involves converting the stored representation back into an in-memory object with the exact same state it had when saved.

joblib leveraging optimized binary file formats that compress and split objects

joblib helps streamline the deployment process. Instead of retraining the model every time the application restarts, 
developers and operations teams can load the saved model into memory and start making predictions.

Network Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection identifies data points that deviate significantly from the norm. 

Random forests, which are ensembles of decision trees, effectively handle complex, high-dimensional data and can be used to detect these anomalous patterns.

is an ensemble machine-learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions
In classification tasks, each tree votes for a class, and the class receiving the majority votes is chosen. In regression tasks, the final prediction is the average of the individual tree outputs.

random forests often generalize better than a single decision tree, reducing overfitting and providing robust performance even in high-dimensional feature spaces.

Three key concepts shape the construction of a random forest:

Bootstrapping: Multiple subsets of the training data are created via sampling with replacement. Each subset trains a separate decision tree.

Tree Construction: For each tree, a random subset of features is considered at every split, ensuring diversity and reducing correlations among trees.

Voting: After all trees are trained, classification involves majority voting, while regression involves averaging predictions.

When used for anomaly detection, a random forest is trained exclusively on data representing normal conditions. 
New, unseen data points are then evaluated against this learned normal behavior.
Points that do not fit well, or that produce low confidence predictions, are flagged as potential anomalies.

The NSL-KDD dataset refines the original KDD Cup 1999 dataset by eliminating redundant entries and correcting imbalanced class distributions. 

NSL-KDD presents balanced, labeled instances of both normal and malicious network activities.

allows practitioners to perform not only binary classification (normal vs. abnormal) but also multi-class detection tasks targeting specific attack types. Such versatility makes NSL-KDD an invaluable resource for developing and testing intrusion detection techniques.
