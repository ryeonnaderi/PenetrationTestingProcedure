nmap -sVC -vv -oa nmap/forgotten ip address

trying to access the port 80 is  showing forbidden

we can try to scan all ports using -p- 

nmap -sVC -vv -p- -oA nmap/forgotten ip address

that did not work either

give the domain a name in /etc/hosts


use feroxbuster 
feroxbuster -u http://forgotten.htb -x php, html,txt -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt -q -C 404, 403
